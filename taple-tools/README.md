## Usage
You can choose how to use the tools by either compiling the code and running them natively or through the Docker image.

Visit the [TAPLE Tools guide](https://www.taple.es/docs/develop/taple-tools) to learn how to use the tools.

### Build From Source
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-tools.git
$ cd taple-tools
$ cargo install --path taple-keygen
$ cargo install --path taple-sign
$ taple-keygen -h
$ taple-sign -h
```
## Docker images
Prebuilt docker images are available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/opencanarias/taple-tools). The project includes [bash scripts](./scripts/) that allow for running utilities stored in the Docker image as if they were native applications. You will have to assign execution permissions to the scripts and add, optionally, add them to the path. 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-tools.git
$ cd taple-tools
$ chmod +x ./scripts/taple-keygen
$ chmod +x ./scripts/taple-sign
$ ./scripts/taple-keygen -h
$ ./scripts/taple-sign -h
```
