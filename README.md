# TAPLE Client

TAPLE (pronounced T+üçé ['tap…ôl]) stands for Tracking (Autonomous) of Provenance and Lifecycle Events. TAPLE is a permissioned DLT solution for traceability of assets and processes. It is:

- **Scalable**: Scaling to a sufficient level for traceability use cases. 
- **Light**: Designed to support resource constrained devices.
- **Flexible**: Have a flexible and adaptable cryptographic scheme mechanism for a multitude of scenarios.
- **Energy-efficient**: Rust powered, TAPLE is sustainable and efficient from the point of view of energy consumption.

TAPLE Client is the reference application for connecting to the TAPLE DLT network. It is written in Rust and internally uses [TAPLE Core](https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-core) to implement the TAPLE protocol.

## Build From Source

Rust versi√≥n 1.67 or higher is required.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-client.git
$ cd taple-client
$ sudo apt install -y libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler cmake
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
$ cargo install --path client
$ taple-client --version
```

## Usage

Example of minimum configuration to start a node. An example identity is used and the REST API is activated.

```sh
taple-client \
  --http \
  -k 7a747ddf55cf9b2ceb3b41a7c7ce9f88f835c120644e3c7522d97520668c8520
